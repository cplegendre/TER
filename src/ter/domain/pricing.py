"""Model prices and the cost arithmetic built on them.

Prices are data, not code: they change on a vendor's schedule, differ by
model and by date, and must be traceable to a source. The domain defines what
a price is (:class:`Rates`), how dated prices resolve (:class:`PriceSchedule`)
and how token counts become dollars. Where the prices come from is a
``PriceBook`` port (``ter.ports``); the shipped adapter reads a dated JSON
file.

All rates are US dollars per million tokens. Cost arithmetic uses the
operation order TER 3 used (``tokens * rate / 1_000_000``) so dollar figures
are bit-for-bit unchanged.
